Thank you for downloading! To install:

1. Open the folder with the vehicle you would like to have the remodel apply to ("For Skorpion G" or "For Standard Skorpion").

2. Open the folder named with the option of your choosing (either "'Mismatched' Skin" or "Standard German Grey Skin"). 

3. Drag both .wotmod files from the above folder to <Your WoT Directory\mods\<Game Version>.

(Example: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\mods\1.4.0.1)

Included are two versions of the remodel - one for the regular Skorpion (unskinned), and one for the Skorpion G, both of which can be used either with a special 'mismatched' camouflage, or in the standard German Grey.
